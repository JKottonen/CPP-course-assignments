# C++ Battleships

## About

This simple game is a project for practicing object oriented programming in c++.

## How to play
- **Run Battleships.exe**
- **Insert seed string for ships** (For example: 54432 will get you 5 ships with lengths of 5, 4, 4, 3 and 2)
- **Insert shooting coordinates** (There is almost no input validator at all, so inputs must be given quite exactly like the game suggests)
- **Win your opponent!**
